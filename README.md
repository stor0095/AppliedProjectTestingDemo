# AppliedProjectTestingDemo
Testing PubNub, API.AI, SpeechKit, and Snapchat navigation.

## Please READ before running this demo

To Run Demo: Make sure you have CocoaPods installed on your computer. In Terminal 'sudo gem install cocoapods'

If you have cocoapods installed. Download zip -> Navigate to project directory in Terminal -> Run 'pod install' -> Open SnapchatCamera.xcworkspace

Voice recognition doesn't work on the iOS simulator, if you want to record your voice you have to run on a device.

Change the background color by sending your favorite color as a message or press record and say your color, then watch the magic unfold. 

Side note: Everything you send is being sent to the api.ai 'agent', therefore you will get a text response that is translated to voice.
