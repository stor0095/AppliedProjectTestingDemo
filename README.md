# AppliedProjectTestingDemo
Testing PubNub, API.AI, SpeechKit, and Snapchat navigation.

## Please READ before running this demo

Voice recognition doesn't work on the iOS simulator, if you want to record your voice you have to run on a device.

Change the background color by sending your favorite color as a message or press record and say your color, then watch the magic unfold. 

Side note: Everything you send is being sent to the api.ai 'agent', therefore you will get a text response that is translated to voice.

### BUG ALERT: If you send a voice command to the agent, he will respond, however, the Audio Engine seems to be disabling the speakers so you can't hear his response. But if you send a text message to agent you will hear his voice.
